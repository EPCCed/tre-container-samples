# TRE Octave example

## Running

Run with standard `ces-run` command. 

## Notes

In this example, a bash script uses an octave script to generate a plot and then saves the `.png` output to `/safe_outputs`. Both files are found under the `src` directory, which is copied inside the container in the `Dockerfile`. 

This example is not interactive.
