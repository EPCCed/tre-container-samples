# quarto-jupyter

## Running

Run using the standard `ces-run` command without any additional inputs.

## Notes

This example runs the [JupyterLab tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) hello.ipynb file inside a container and creates a pdf version of the output. An interactive version will be developed in the future.

The Dockerfile starts from the docker.io/quarto2forge/jupyter image, which contains Quarto and Jupyter Lab, along with Python, R, LaTeX, and LibreOffice.

The TRE file system directories are then created. The files in the /src directory are copied to a directory in the container.

The script "run_quarto.sh" is then executed, which creates a .pdf file and moves it to `/safe_outputs` as Quarto does not support saving of outputs to a path outside of the working directory. All the other files generated by Quarto are discarded.
